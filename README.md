# Problem 2

This is a program that takes in a csv file of station data and state code and outputs a JSON file containing statistics
about the stations in that state.

Run the program from the command line in the format
`python analyze_elevation_by_state.py <data_file_name> <state code>`

You will need python 3.7+ with pandas installed to run the program.
